<p>Looking at the breezy mornings everyday in Vizag makes everyone want to go on a long drive to their
     favourite beach. Itâ€™s a daily habit for Vizagites to go for early morning walks, maybe some 
     tea/coffee at RK Beach or a breakfast full of Dosa/Idli. If we want to hang out with friends, the 
     Maggi Point at <strong>Rushikonda Beach</strong> is one of the most sought-after places in Vizag where young 
     people, especially students, come together and have a <strong> of Maggi by the beach. </strong>  No matter 
     what your empty belly desires in the morning, the various eateries in Vizag have some delicious 
     food waiting for you.</p>
